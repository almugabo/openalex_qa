scripts to process files and upload in the database 

they are based on the scripts but they were adapted to allow parallel processing of the files 

This allows to process the files in under 1 hour (usinf 20 cores) 

Note: 
a lot of hard coded parameters ... if there is interest I could rewrite them into a package
