# Coverage

* The discussions about “coverage” builds on the work by Bianca Kramer and Cameron Neylon. 
Kramer, Bianca, & Neylon, Cameron. (2021, December 9). Coverage and completeness: comparing sources of open metadata. FORCE2021, [online](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5770835). Zenodo. 

* In their work, they compared the OpenAlex and Crossref at the level of records and journals.  They show that Crossref is essential a subset of OpenAlex, but there are differences like the 27 Mio records in Crossref but not in OpenAlex

----
* Here the focus is on the assessment of the coverage of "publication channels" and "meta data"  (as shown in the chart below). The focus is not on the number of items in each channel (this is foreseen in "completeness") but whether a given channel (eg. a journal) is covered or not. (for the metadata the same: whether a given metadata is covered or not, irrespective of the number of entries/null values)

* In a first step, we assess the extent to which OpenAlex covers journals from [selected lists]( https://github.com/almugabo/open_metadata/wiki/Journals)
